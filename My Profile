<h1>About me</h1>
<p>Hello Reader,</p>
<p>My name is Brandon Anderson.</p>
<p>My RMIT Student email is: s3816471@student.rmit.edu.au</p>
<p>My Personal Email is: brandon.anderson13@hotmail.com</p>
<p>I am a 20-year-old male who spends 80% of his life on the internet. I only speak English, I graduated from year 12 in 2017, in 2018 I completed a Certificate 4 in Graphic Design and was studying a Diploma of Graphic Design in 2019 but stopped the course because I found I was no longer enjoying it. </p>
<p>I live at home in a small town called Moama, with my Mum, My sister and my partner. I have 2 dogs, Bailey and Jax. I am currently unemployed, however I’m always searching for work. My life isn’t very interesting I play video games almost all day and I’m not what you call tech smart, however I’m hoping to change that, but one thing not many people know is I love to draw, I’ve loved drawing from a young age.
