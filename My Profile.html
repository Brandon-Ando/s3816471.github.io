<font size="5"><p>Hello Reader,</p>

<p>My name is Brandon Anderson</p>

<img src="Me.jpg" class="w1-round" alt="Norway" style="width:480px;height:853px;">

<p> ^ That Is Me ^ </p>

<p> My Student Number : s3816471n </p>

<p>My RMIT Student email is: s3816471@student.rmit.edu.au</p>

<p> I am a 20-year-old male who spends 80% of his life on the internet.
  <br /> I only speak English, I graduated from year 12 in 2017 and in 2018, I completed a Certificate IV in Graphic Design at Bendigo TAFE.
  <br /> I then continued by studying a Diploma of Graphic Design in 2019, but stopped the course because I found I was no longer enjoying it.

</p>

<p> I live at home in a small town called Moama, with my Mum, my sister and my partner. I have 2 dogs, Bailey and Jax.
  <br /> I am currently unemployed, however I’m always searching for work.
  <br /> My life isn’t very interesting. I play video games almost all day and I’m not what you would call ‘tech smart’, however I’m hoping to change that.
  <br /> One thing not many people know is I love to draw; I’ve loved drawing from a very young age.

</p>

<p>
I have chosen to study a Bachelor of Information Technology with the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) for a few reasons.
<br /> The first of these reasons is because I love technology. I spend most my days online, whether it be searching the web, watching videos, on social media or gaming.
<br /> Because I spend so much time using technology, I have decided to undertake in this course to learn more about it.
<br /> My sister once said to me, “if you’re passionate about what you do for a living, you’ll never work a day in your life.”
<br /> The last reason I’ve enrolled in this course is because I believe the world of Technology is becoming more and more prevalent in our society, and will only continue to grow.
<br /> To keep up with the world and its technological advances, I would like to learn all the skills around information technology, and I strongly feel this course will help me do that.

</p>

<p> For me, what makes IT interesting is how many endless opportunities there are.
  <br /> The world of it is forever changing and expanding. However, what really interests me the most is how everything around me works.
  <br /> For example, I built my own gaming pc earlier this year with the help of a tech smart friend and although I have a brief understanding on what the components do,
  <br /> I would love to find out how they all work together to create such a widely used part of our digital world, the computer.

</p>

<p> During my time of studying the Bachelor of Information Technology, I would love to learn the ins and outs of the world of IT.
  <br /> Things such as, how the motherboard functions and acts as the ‘brain’ of the computer and how all the other components operate and work together.
  <br /> I would also like to gain a deeper understanding of how the world of IT works, from programing to Artificial Intelligence.

</p>

<p> After graduation, I hope to find a career out of the skills I have learnt throughout my time in this course,
  <br /> to help support my family and move forward in life.
  <br /> I want to bring my passion for IT to life in a career that excites me and challenges me everyday that I wake up.

</p>

<font size="4" font color="0033ff"><h1>My Ideal Job</h1> </font>

<p> My ideal job; for me, this question was hard, but I believe my ideal job would have to be an Information Technology Consultant.
  <br /> I’ve never really thought about it before, but after a lot of research this job of being an IT Consultant has really grabbed my attention.

</p>

<p> The role of an IT Consultant appeals to me because it’s all about helping people.
  <br /> IT Consultants work on and off the field with their clients to help them find the solutions with their IT problems.
  <br /> The role of an IT consultant is to also train IT staff, analyze and organize data,
  <br /> compiling and presenting information and also to come up with more efficient and effective ways to manage systems.
<br /> The key skills required to become an Information Technology Consultant is the ability to work efficiently with a team, but to also have the ability to work efficiently alone.
 <br /> Other skills that are required are productivity, Word Processing Experience, Creative Software,
  <br /> A Technical Understanding of Computer Systems and Networks, along with good Communication Skills.

</p>

<p> The certification to become an IT Consultant is a Bachelor’s Degree in Information Technology, Computer Science or another related field.
  <br /> A High School Diploma or a GED is also optional, however employers prefer to employ those who have completed high-school or equivalent.
  <br /> The minimum experience for IT Consultants varies, however is usually a minimum of 1 year.
</p>
<p> The skills required for an IT Consultant that I already possess are; the ability to work with a team as well as alone,
  <br /> Word Processing Experience, Productivity and a small understanding of Creative Software’s.
  <br /> The certificates I have already achieved is a high school diploma. And as for experience, as of now, very little.

<p> The first test I did was from a site called 16 Personalities.
  <br /> The Personality I got was Adventurer. The results I got from this online test tells me that I am an extremely emotional person and often let my emotions decide my actions.
  <br /> This test also states that I am an introvert but have a very creative mind.
  <br /> Being an Adventurer can affect the way I work with others in both a good and bad way.
  <br /> To start with, I find it hard to commit to long term plans, and to top it off I am a person to get easily stressed with a task and myself if something doesn’t go as planned.
  <br /> On the positive side, I am a very curious person, meaning I am a person who will go out of their way to learn something new.
  <br /> Being an Adventurer also means that I am a passionate person, so when I find something that I enjoy it will be hard to focus on other stuff.
  <br /> When forming a team, I need to find people who not only can deal with my feelings, but also have the patience to work with me.
  <br /> While choosing a team I also need to find someone who can fill in the parts I cannot, for example,
  <br /> someone who can focus for a long period of time and motivate me to keep going.

<p> The second test I did was from a site called Education Planner, it was a learning style test.
<br /> The learning style I got was a visual learner. The results show me that my biggest learning strategy is utilising images and texts.
<br /> Being a visual learner affects the way I work with others, because I am easily distracted by many things, especially noises.
<br /> I may also be affected while working with a team because I have difficulty understanding and following spoken instructions.
<br /> When forming a team, I need to find people who are able to explain information in a way that I can
<br /> form an image in my mind or even have the patience to explain something to me in a way I will understand.

  <p> The third test I did was from a site called testmycreativity.com, it was a creativity test.
  <br /> The score I got was 44.92. The results from this test tells me that my main creativity aspect is complexity,
  <br /> meaning I have the ability to take in a large quantity of information at one time and use it, plus my prior knowledge,
  <br /> to identify relationships and create something new. The test also states that I have low boldness,
  <br /> which refers to not having the confidence to push set barriers, nor do I have the ability to not let what others think or say about me affect me.
  <br /> The score I got from this test suggests that I am persistent, which will help when working in groups because I will always be willing to learn and won’t give up until I have.
  <br /> When forming a team I will need to look for people who will be friendly and respectful, even If I make mistakes and not judge me for any mistakes I may make.

<font size="4" font color="0033ff"><h1>My Project Idea</h1> </font>

<br />

<font size="2"><h1>Overview</h1> </font>

<p> For my project idea, I have chosen to go with an app. This app will be available on both Android and IOS.
  <br /> The app will be based around a game I play almost every day, called RuneScape.
  <br /> RuneScape also has an alternative game called OldSchool RuneScape, which is the same game but with all the features and graphics that the game had back in 2004.
  <br /> This app will be a day to day updated information source on the in-games stock market (referred to as the grand exchange in-game).
  <br /> The app will have the up to date pricing of all the best traded items.

</p>

<br />

<font size="2"><h1>Motivation</h1> </font>

<p> This app will be an interesting feature to all those who play RuneScape and have an interest in the Grand Exchange.
  <br /> There are at least 50,000 people playing RuneScape at the one time, 20,000 on the RuneScape 3 servers and 30,000 on OldSchool RuneScape servers.
  <br /> The app will be useful because it will give up to date information on the rise and fall of prices for all of the top traded items for both the original OldSchool RuneScape,
  <br /> as well as the top items that have reached the lowest value point over the last six months.

</p>

<br />

<font size="2"><h1>Description</h1> </font>

<p> I have decided that this application will be called the ‘Grand Exchange Tracker’ or ‘G E Tracker’ for short.
<br />
<br /> This will be an up to date application that will have all the information on the RuneScape Grand Exchange prices of every item.
<br /> The app will also show rise and fall graphs of items that have reached the lowest pricing from the last 6 months.
<br /> I picture this application having a tracking component where the user can save a certain item, to see its current pricing at any given time.
<br /> This way, avid players can track their most used items and make sure they’re getting them at ‘bargain’ prices.
<br /> This feature will be accessible through a part of the app that will show all saved items,
<br /> as well as notifications when a saved item goes up in value or drops in value. The user of the app,
<br /> will be able to decide if they want these notification pop ups enabled on their device.
<br />
<br /> The application will have a section where the user will be able to go and look at the other users tracked items
<br /> this feature will be helpful to players new to the Grand Exchange and be able to give them an idea on the best items to trade.
<br /> There will also be a home page that will show the top recommended items of the day.
<br /> This application will have a feature where it will show where the items prices might be going in the near future,
<br /> whether the prices may be rising or decreasing, depending on recent changes.
<br />
<br /> This application will be a free app on both Android and IOS, however there will be paid privileges in the app.
<br /> These privileges will add the feature to track as many items as you would like. Without having these privileges,
<br /> you would only be able to save as many as 10 items at one time. To get the privileges of a subscribed user,
<br /> a player will have to pay a one-time only cost of around $7 to $10 AUD$.
<br />
<br /> The other features accessed by becoming a paid subscriber will include, the use of the feature to compare and check other users item lists and recently checked items.
<br /> Being a paid member will also remove adds from within the app. Other benefits from
<br /> becoming a paid subscriber will allow the user to be able to communicate with the other paid users through private messages and through a VIP chat group.
<br /> The App will have a section for all users to access that will be a forum like page where a user can go and comment a question, which other players will then be able to answer and help out.
<br />
<br /> There will also be a feature when users can go and suggest new feature they would like to see, or something they would like to see change.
<br /> This will also include a section where users can report and bugs or mistakes within the application.
<br />
<br /> This application will have to be signed into every time it is accessed,
<br /> however you will be able to save passwords and usernames to make it an easier procedure.
<br /> The accounts will save the items you have chosen to save and will allow the user to access the application from any Android and IOS devices.
<br /> It will also help keep personal details secure.

</p>

<br />

<font size="2"><h1>Tools And Technology</h1> </font>

<p> The main hardware used in this project will be the device itself, this could be any phone, tablet or iPad that runs either Android or IOS software.
  <br /> The application will need to be written in both JavaScript for access on the android devices but also written in Swift for access on IOS devices.
  <br /> This app will require an API (Application Programming Interface) software to receive and display data from the main RuneScape Grand Exchange website.
  <br /> This application will also need access to a cloud technology like Google Drive, to save password and associated data from both Android devices and IOS devices.

</p>

<br />

<font size="2"><h1>Skills Required</h1> </font>

<p> The skills needed to make this project idea a reality is a knowledge in Mobile App programming.
  <br /> This will be needed to write the program to make everything work.
  <br /> Another skill will be someone who is able to design the applications logo and user interface.
  <br /> The app will need someone to apply and maintain the API to the Website
  <br /> <a href="http://services.runescape.com/m=itemdb_rs/"> http://services.runescape.com/m=itemdb_rs/ </a> where the app will collect its data from.
  <br /> The App will also need a cloud system that is compatible with both Android and IOS,
  <br /> to collect and store the data from the users. (such as the Passwords and usernames, and all data that is associated with those accounts.).
  <br /> The only other skills needed will be that the user knows how to install and open the application.

</p>

<br />

<font size="2"><h1>Outcome</h1> </font>

<p> The outcome of this application will be a very positive and helpful one for many of the RuneScape users both old and new to the trading systems.
  <br /> If this project idea becomes a reality and successful, then all RuneScape players new and old will be able to get a hold of more useful
  <br /> information to get them started on GE Trading, which serves as a valuable way to progress through the game.
  <br /> This app could help in getting more players into the trading scheme which in return will profit the players who are already trading.
  <br /> If this app becomes successful, it may become an app or website that computer users will be able to use.
